Tasks to do:
1. Update Gurobi code to work with new Gurobi version and to mirror changes in CBC ILP.

2. Repair ilp_solver/__init__.py to use Gurobi as the default ILP solver.

3. Get OR clauses working.

Thoughts:
1. ILPs have limitations in: timeslot / hour angle integration and partial scheduling.

2. ILPs will likely make AND / OR much easier, if we can make variables dependent on the values of other variables.
ORs should be doable with GA, but much harder to enforce. Do we filter at end or make sure during the GA that any
schedule without one of the OR observations in it dies? Since we are scheduling GS + GN separately, this might be
very difficult. We might want to join into one schedule, like ILPs have, with a boundary where the split is between
the GN and GS time slots. This will require significant changes and will lead to less chromosomes, which may be
detrimental, but it would fix the issue of one site getting a benefit over the other site.

3. The bookkeeping with partial scheduling with GAs will be very difficult, especially when it comes to the chromosome
operations.

4. Get the proper sum of schedules as per talk with Bryan.
