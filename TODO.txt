Tasks to do:
1. Make sure start_slots are being used correctly in the ILP program.

2. Check the genetic algorithm's weird behaviour: why, for example, are the GN scores so low?

3. To understand:
If I look at the first observation in the data set, GS-2018B-FT-208-18, it only has weights for weight_gs and not for weight_gn (so only schedulable at weight_gs); furthermore, it has 382 entries in weight_gs, so it can be scheduled in that range (provided it fits in the 382, of course).
On the other hand, for this observations, wha_gs has 822 entries, which is more than the 516 total time slots available for the GS 12 degree twilight sunset to sunrise.
Iâ€™m not clear why there are so many entries in wha_gs.

4. Input JIRA tasks

Thoughts:
1. ILPs have limitations in: timeslot / hour angle integration and partial scheduling.

2. ILPs will likely make AND / OR much easier.

3. The bookkeeping with partial scheduling with GAs will be very difficult, especially when it comes to the chromosome
   operations.
